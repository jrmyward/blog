          %h2 Hello!
        %p
          My name is Jeremy Ward. I'm an adventure-seeking, problem solver living outside of Portland, Oregon. I am the owner of #{link_to "OC Digital", 'http://ocdigital.co', title: 'OC Digital'}, a small digital development shop. I'm the creator of #{link_to 'Fitrme', 'https://fitrme.com', title: 'Fitrme - The Personal Fitness Revolution'}, an awesome fitness web app that I hope to release to the public by the end of 2014. Most of my days are spent writing code â€“ mostly Ruby.
        %p I grew up in Alger, Ohio. I became a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) at the age of 19. I rang-in 2003 in Oberhof, Germany with World Cup skiiers from around the world. I married an amazing woman; the love of my life. I've been successful in business and also failed. I've travled from East to West and back again. I've experienced the wind in my hair sailing on azure seas. I understand life is about the moments and the connections you make along the way.
        %p Thank you for reading!
